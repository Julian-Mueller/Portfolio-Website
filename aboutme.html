                                <p class="aboutMeText">From a young age on I wanted to do something related to graphic design or media design. 
                                Later in the final years of high school I started developing interest in Psychology. From then on, I wanted to study psychology because I was really interested in how and why people think and behave. In general, I was also the kind of person who was really investigative and curious on 
                                how things work. Shortly before graduating from high-school my mom went on a sailing trip. Now, you might ask yourself how this is related either to UX Design and me. Coincidentally, my mother met a woman on the ship who was working as a (*drumroll*) UX Designer. After returning from her journey, my mother told me all about UX Design (I still believe that I would not have never discovered it, if it wasn’t for that trip). I realised that instead of studying plain psychology, that job would combine both my interests in psychology and design. Therefore, I went on searching for an optimal study program related to UX which eventually led me to The Hague University of Applied Sciences. But before I moved to the Netherlands, I took a gap year in which I was working at a supermarket as preparation for the move. Additionally, I was studying computer science and sociology at my local university. Finally, a year later I moved to the Netherlands and started my studies in UX Design in September 2020. Currently I am at the beginning of the second semester.<br>
                                Outside of studying UX I am very interested in both sports and fitness. I am a major football (soccer) fan and follower of the NBA. I play football and basketball myself and do calisthenics. Other than that, I am very interested in music. I play and played guitar as well as drums from a young age on. With the big band of my school, I played internally and externally infront of mayor audiences.</p>

                                <p class="aboutMeText">Although I am currently still at the beginning of my studies, I have already learned about several components and techniques within the stages of the Design Thinking Process: Empathising, Defining, Ideation, Prototyping and Testing. But also about intercultural competence, UX Factors and ethnicity in design. Therefore I am experienced with the common design and protyping tools. Moreover, I developed crucial UX Design skills such as User Research and empathising, information architecture, visualising, coding and protyping. However, I noticed that I found most joy in the empathising and protyping phase of the design process.</p>
                                <p class="aboutMeText">The techniques I learned are: Design Briefs, Ethnographic Research, Observational Research, Personas, User Portraits, User Flows, Storyboards, User Stories, Sitemaps, Diverging and Converging Techniques, Ideation, Sketching, Wireframes, Mockups, Paper Prototyping, Low-Fidelity Prototyping, High-Fidelity Prototyping, Visualising and User Testing.</p> 
                                <p class="aboutMeText">I believe that UX Designers have huge responsibility because we have a lot of influence on the every day life of users. But also have the power to manipulate. I, however, aspire to create ethically correct and meaningful design solutions that will benefit users all around the world by having a positive impact on their lives.</p>
                                <p class="aboutMeText">Studying entirely in English in an international setting will give me an enormous advantage working in a modern, intercultural business environment. But more importantly, it helps me developing as a person.</p>
